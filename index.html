        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Seasoned programmer with a wide range of engineering and development experience.</p>
        <p> I love Javascript and particularly node js.</p>
        <p>
          I am very experienced in Javascript development, I've been at it for a decade and a half now. I have transitioned from the initial horror that comes from thinking Javascript is some sort of Java to the elation of discovering that it is really some type of Lisp. In the frontend I've used jQuery, straight JS, Angular and React. In the backend I've written node servers for many projects, the most significant being the <a href="#booking">white label I made for Booking.com</a>. I'll write cli tools using Javascript. I even start up a node REPL when I want to analyze data.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the job with Booking.com my attention was diverted to matters in my personal life that prevented me from accepting any work requiring more than a few days per week. To keep the fires burning I did a lots of freelance jobs for <a href="https://www.netklaar.nl/">NetKlaar</a>. The more interresting were the reimplementation of an eCommerce site <a href="#dps">DPS BV</a> and a greenfield project <a href="#keeper">keeperstrainer.com</a>. These projects were implemented in NetKlaar's in house stack, namely PHP, mySQL and TYPO3 CMS.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past I've written device drivers, communication protocol drivers, security implementations, financial service application development, note and coin handling applications, middleware and realtime software.

            <h4>24uzr</h4>
            <p>My pet personal project is a race planner for the 24 hour sailing race. This annual race has a unique format wherebij you must sail as far as you can in a 24 hour time period along a selection of possible legs. It is an interesting strategic puzzle and a fabulous mathematical puzzle at the same time.</p>
            <p>Whenever I need to learn a new programming language or framework I always look to this puzzle to provide the content of my autodidactic endeavour.</p>
            <p>Mathematically speaking it is a graph search/pathfinding problem maximizing distance sailed and minimizing the delta to 24 hours. Exhaustive search becomes intractable on a single machine long before the 24 hours is reached so finding an optimal search algorithm is neccessary.</p>
            <p>Besides the mathematical puzzle it is also good puzzle for application development. The application is multiple clients have realtime analysis of their progress and a selection of optimal solutions given their actual progress. This requires a application client, backend services to collate and provide neccessary information such as wind predictions and a routing service to do the pathfinding.</p>
            <p>I've built this once before using Angular in the client, node.js in the backend and with a routing service written node.js with the actual graph routines implemented in C++. Unfortunately this is not currently hosted so I can't show it to you.</p>
            <p>The current instance of this project is progressing nicely and uses react in the client, node.js for the backend and the routing service written in Go.</p>

          <p>My chief responsibility was the development of features in the React front end. I am also a very capable backend developer so

            <p>Built a scaling white label implementation of Booking.com's front end.  The backend communicated with a proprietry interface for content and avaiability and bookings. Our customers were hotel chians such as Marriot and Best Western. A given white label instance was generated from a declarative configuration specifying the theme and landing pages.
            </p>
            <p>The project was very successful and provided the basis of Booking.com's Hotel Services division. Unfortunately Booking.com decided that they needed to reimplement the product in their house language Perl. We stopped developing features for the rewrite and while we were doing this they bought a company with a similar product and more market penetration.</p>

            <span class="timespan">2011 – 2013</span>
            <span class="location">Utrecht, Netherlands</span>
            <p>In 2011 I started a long contract for the Bureau Ketenontwikkeling Werk en Income (BKWI) where I lobbied for and implemented a professionalisation of their web development department. Specifically, I got them using version control (GIT) and continuous integration (ANT, Jenkins).</p>
            <p>I was initially employed in a team of four developers to implement <a target="_blank" href="https://www.naleving.net/">www.naleving.net</a> which is a community site with features like communities (where general posts can be gathered together for interest groups) and the ability to follow other users. It’s all built from GIT with versioned DB update scripts for a reproducible deployment to the test, acceptance or production server. Naleving was a large project spanning six months. It was built on pi_base and ###TEMPLATES### with a lot of typoscript. This left us with strong motivation to move on to ExtBase development.</p>
            <p>After Naleving went live we started building sites using ExtBase and Fluid templates. This went well enough but eventually we decided to switch to FLOW, an MVC architecture that is being build by the TYPO3 community.</p>
            <p>My last project at BKWI was a reimplementation <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kernkaart.nl">Kernkaart.nl</a>. Kernkaart is a tool that decision makers in federal and gemeente politics can use compare the performance of gemeentes with respect to indicators calculated from census (CBS) data. The application needs to process reasonably large amounts of data to produce the indicator values which led us to use CouchDB. CouchDB enabled us to perform complex calculations over the data sets offline keeping the response times of page requests down.</p>
